# BeamZ rasterization

This package turns analytic geometry, GDSFactory layer stacks, and closed
triangle meshes into static real tensor material arrays. Permittivity and
permeability may be isotropic, diagonal, or symmetric positive-definite 3x3
tensors; conductivity may be symmetric positive-semidefinite.

## API

```python
import beamz
import beamz.design.raster as raster

scene = raster.Scene(
    materials=(
        beamz.Material(),
        beamz.Material(permittivity=((12.1, 0, 0), (0, 11.8, 0), (0, 0, 10.9))),
    ),
    objects=(
        raster.Object(
            raster.Box((0, 0, 0), (2e-6, 0.5e-6, 0.22e-6)),
            material_id=1,
        ),
    ),
)
grid = raster.Grid.uniform(
    (0, -0.5e-6, -0.1e-6),
    (2e-6, 1e-6, 0.4e-6),
    (80, 60, 8),
)
result = raster.rasterize(scene, grid)
```

The public package exports:

- `Scene`, `Object`, and scalar/diagonal/symmetric-tensor `Material`
- `Grid`, including explicit nonuniform edges and `Grid.uniform()`
- boxes, spheres, cylinders, extruded polygons, tapered polygons, and meshes
- `RasterOptions`, `RasterResult`, and `CompiledScene`
- `compile_scene()`, `rasterize()`, and `inspect_mesh()`

`RasterOptions` has three choices: `quality` (`fast`, `balanced`, or
`reference`), `smoothing` (`volume`, `farjadpour_diagonal`, or
`farjadpour_full`, or `contour_path`), and `components` (`all`, `two_dimensional_tm`, or
`two_dimensional_te`). Standalone rasterization defaults to `farjadpour_full`.
Adaptive
tolerances and threading remain internal. Farjadpour modes use the generalized
local-interface tensor transform for permittivity and permeability;
conductivity remains volume averaged.

`RasterResult` contains immutable grid edges, cell-centered `tensors`, summary
diagnostics, and constitutive `yee_tensors` integrated independently over the
Ex/Ey/Ez and Hx/Hy/Hz dual volumes. Full smoothing also integrates epsilon at
the grid nodes shared by the off-diagonal electric terms. Tensor arrays use one
leading component for isotropic materials, three `(xx, yy, zz)` components for
diagonal materials, and six `(xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz)` components for full
symmetric materials. It does not produce dense material-ID, boundary-mask, or
error arrays.

Farjadpour smoothing is applied only when the surface patches crossing one Yee
support form a reliable, sign-invariant lamination axis. Boxes and straight
extruded polygons are partitioned at their z boundaries, resolved by priority
then object ID, and unioned by material before integration. Their disjoint
volumes are integrated exactly (up to polygon-clipping roundoff), including
holes and different extrusion heights. Only exposed material boundaries
contribute normals: duplicate objects and hidden core/slab seams do not disable
smoothing. Equal material-table entries are treated as one physical material.

Polygon Boolean operations use the `geo` integer overlay lattice (approximately
29 bits per XY half-extent). Input axis coordinates within a scale-derived
clipping-roundoff tolerance are restored after each operation to keep aligned
faces aligned. This is a
clipping precision limit, independent of the adaptive quality preset; features
below that XY precision are not resolved. Regression tolerances of `2e-6` on
float32 constitutive outputs cover clipping and output roundoff for the tested
geometries, rather than promising a universal fraction-error bound.

Corners, non-coplanar mesh patches, unresolved geometry, and overlaps involving
unsupported curved/tapered/mesh unions still fall back to tensor volume
averaging. Identical fully occluded primitives are removed before adaptive
integration; an unrelated curved object does not disable exact extrusion
integration elsewhere. Adaptive disagreement remains an estimate, not a strict
error bound. Summary diagnostics count sampled supports across all requested
components and cells, not physical-cell percentages, and do not allocate dense
diagnostic fields. Scene hashes retain the original input representation;
cached results from the older ownership algorithm are invalidated.

Compile once when rasterizing one scene on several grids:

```python
compiled = raster.compile_scene(scene)
coarse = compiled.rasterize(coarse_grid)
fine = compiled.rasterize(fine_grid)
```

Passing `cache_directory=` enables atomic, schema-versioned NPZ caching with
corrupt-cache recovery.

## Standalone versus simulation use

Standalone rasterization accepts uniform and nonuniform rectilinear grids.
BeamZ's FDTD engine accepts the same realized rectilinear grid and applies the
local Yee edge, face, and volume metrics in its curl updates and CFL limit. It
extracts the target diagonal from each electric support tensor. For
`farjadpour_full`, it compiles the inverse diagonal at each E support and the
inverse cross terms at shared grid nodes, then uses the paper's
average-multiply-average coupling. Full coupling currently requires zero
electric conductivity and unit permeability; use CPML rather than a conductive
sponge PML with that mode.

Imported scenes use the same simulation workflow as BeamZ designs; the
solver-specific conversion stays internal:

```python
import beamz
from beamz.design.raster import Grid
from beamz.design.raster.importers import from_mesh

scene = from_mesh("device.msh", material=beamz.Material(permittivity=12.0))
raster_grid = Grid.uniform(minimum, maximum, shape)
simulation = beamz.Simulation(
    scene=scene,
    raster_grid=raster_grid,
    run_time=1e-12,
)
```

The simulation domain and physical coordinates are taken directly from the
grid's edge arrays.

For standalone inspection, `scene.rasterize(raster_grid)` returns the general
`RasterResult`. `MaterialGrid.from_raster_result()` remains an advanced explicit
boundary for callers that need to retain or transform that result themselves.

`Design.rasterize()` returns a `MaterialGrid` directly, always uses the Rust
engine, and selects the reduced TMz or TEz work set requested by the simulation.
Pre-sampled
spatial coefficients enter `Simulation` directly as `MaterialGrid`; there is no
second Python geometry rasterizer or engine-selection switch.

Normal simulations use diagonal Farjadpour smoothing. Full lossless coupling can
be requested explicitly:

```python
import beamz

simulation = beamz.Simulation(
    design=design,
    raster_options=raster.RasterOptions(smoothing="farjadpour_full"),
    run_time=1e-12,
)
```

The compiler consumes those native Yee arrays directly. Full-tensor
conductivity, full permittivity combined with conductivity, and non-unit
permeability fail with a capability-specific message. Conductive diagonal
materials propagate in FDTD but are rejected for `ModeSource` until the mode
bridge represents their frequency-dependent complex permittivity. The current
mode-source and mode-monitor bridge rejects explicitly supplied nonuniform
rectilinear grids. `GridSpec.auto()` selects a compatible uniform grid when a
mode source, mode monitor, or Gaussian beam is present. `GaussianSource`,
`CustomSource`, and field/flux monitors work on graded grids. The current 2D and public
convenience mode solvers use the cell-tensor approximation for diagonal
Farjadpour grids and reject full off-diagonal coupling; the 3D launch planner
retains its Yee-aware refinement path.

## Importers

```python
from beamz.design.raster.importers import (
    from_gdsfactory,
    from_mesh,
    from_mesh_arrays,
    repair_mesh,
)
```

- `from_gdsfactory()` reads PDK layer stacks, derived layer regions, sidewalls,
  material maps, and callable or tabulated `z_to_bias` profiles.
- `from_mesh()` reads meshio-supported surfaces such as STL and extracts closed
  boundaries from Gmsh tetrahedral physical regions.
- `from_mesh_arrays()` accepts raw vertices and triangles.
- `repair_mesh()` uses optional trimesh operations and returns an auditable
  immutable report.

All importers return reusable `Scene` objects. GDSFactory, meshio, and trimesh
remain optional dependencies.

PDK material names have no implicit production constants. Pass `material_map`
with the intended values. `use_builtin_materials=True` is an explicit opt-in to
approximate nondispersive values near 1.55 µm.

Meshes must be closed, consistently oriented, manifold, nondegenerate, and free
of self-intersections. `inspect_mesh()` and scene compilation share the same
native scale-aware validity predicate.

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
env -u CONDA_PREFIX uv run maturin develop
uv run pytest tests/unit/raster \
  tests/integration/test_native_design_rasterization.py
```

### Spatial ownership inspection

Development builds can inspect selected cell and Ex/Ey/Ez supports without
changing the public API or allocating diagnostic volumes in ordinary runs.
The ignored Rust test `write_spatial_ownership_diagnostics` accepts JSON with
`scene`, `grid` (`x_edges`, `y_edges`, `z_edges`), and `supports` (component name
and `[x, y, z]` index). Set `BEAMZ_RASTER_INSPECTION_INPUT` and
`BEAMZ_RASTER_INSPECTION_OUTPUT` to the input and JSONL output paths, then run:

```bash
cargo test --release -p fdtd-raster-core write_spatial_ownership_diagnostics -- --ignored
```

Each output record gives support bounds, material fractions, the resolved normal,
smoothing status, fallback reason, and epsilon. The crossing-specific
`scripts/inspect_raster_ownership.py` selects XY/XZ supports, validates fractions
against GEOS, and plots the physical nonuniform support widths. See
[issue #242 evidence](../../../tests/differential/results/issue-242/README.md)
for the selection, denominators, measured S parameters, and reproduction commands.

The experimental [`contour_path` option](contour_path.md) uses distinct Yee
line/surface integrals for positive isotropic dielectrics. See the derivation,
supported configurations, and counted volume fallbacks before using it.
